View
===========================================
this section is about urls starting by http://www.google.com/reader/view/
All url starting by http://www.google.com/reader/view/ are html pages that use AJAX code to show atom feeds found from http://www.google.com/reader/atom/.
You can append to the base url any set of items suffix to view only that set of items. Note however that   GET parameters are not valid (in fact are ignored) for those urls.

You can browse directly all items from xkcd main feed by going to http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/http://xkcd.com/rss.xml even if you didn't subscribed to it (in which case there will be a button "Subscribe" on the top of the screen). Note however that if you're not identified, you'll browse the feed using the old interface (lens) and not the new on (<application Name>).
